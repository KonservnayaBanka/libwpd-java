= Java bindings for libwpd
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos-at-frugalware-dot-org>

NOTE: This page is here only for historical reasons. You probably want
to have a look at
http://libwpd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libwpd/libwpd-bindings;a=summary[the
opened code].

== What's libwpd-java?

libwpd-java is an attempt to work with
link:http://libwpd.sourceforge.net/[libwpd] in Java.

== Why is it good?

- If you have a Java application and you want to work with WordPerfect
  (tm) documents, you'll find it useful.

- It binds libwpd's custom types to native Java types, like
  `WPXPropertyList` to `java.util.LinkedHashMap<String,String>`.

== How does it work?

The code at the moment is not yet public. Here are my plans:

- I wait for somebody who really needs this.

- I want to get paid for my work. If you, or your company are interested
  in funding, please contact me.

- To be legal and respect GPL, I want to publish the work under
  GPL as well, and submit the code for inclusion in the libwpd project.

== Example

As an example, you can see how the Java version of the original wpd2raw
C++ program looks like, using libwpd-java:

- `main.java`:

[java]
source~~~~
include::main.java[]
source~~~~

- `RawListenerImpl.java`

[java]
source~~~~
include::RawListenerImpl.java[]
source~~~~

Enjoy!
